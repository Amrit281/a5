# This is the final assessment for my WEB322 course that I took in my third semester while studying the
# Computer Programmer diploma in Seneca College. The task was to clone the Airbnb.ca from scartch to the
# exact copy of it. We created this website in 5 parts, in first part we created a single page application
# which we run with the help of the routers. In the second part we created 2 additional pages and navigated
# throught the pages with the help routers, the main focus of the course was towards the backend programming
# in Javascript, in the third part we created login and signup forms and connected it with the database,
# we used mongoDB to handle all the data. It was a great experience with mongoDB as it changed the whole 
# scenario that we earlier in the program with SQL, anyways fourth part was a bit more tricky where we had
# to secure certain pages with for the users only, that means only the person who logged in can have access
# to those pages. And then at the end we created the room list and we added the feature to book a room from
# there. Overall, the project really good I learned a lot while doing it, also it was my first big/multipage
# project so I was excited at the beginning and I really enjoyed doing it.
